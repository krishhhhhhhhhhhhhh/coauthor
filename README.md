- Describe matrices Matlab style ("A = [1, 2, 3; 2, 4, 5]")
- Simply write out names of theorems or equations and translate them directly ("The equation for Multihead Attention from Attention is All You Need" or "Insert the Time Hierarchy Theorem").
- Automatically create typeset tables ("A table with three columns titled Name, School, and Email").
- And many more left for you to discover...
